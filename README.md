## Project setup
Install Visual Studio 2017 and the C++ Desktop Tools, as we need them for our native module. Also this command helps
```
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
npm install ./src/hot-keys/ItemHotkeys/send-keys-native
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
