// Explanation:
// the Ability class is the hotkey, that you can alter in the ui. Example:
// Ability.Create("Move", "btnmove", "cmdmove", "M", "M", [])
// Where the most Parameters are as follow:
// Ability.Create(<Name in the UI>, <name of the icon>, <name of the hotkey command>, <default hotkey>, [])
// the [] on the end is and array of "Extended Abilities" that open up, when you select the ability. You can see it as sub hotkeys.
// An example is the peasent build hotkey, which is on B, but if you enter that menu, you get more options on what buildings you can build, which also have hotkeys.
// The same goes for hero ability selections for example.
// To add extended abilities, do something like that
// Ability.Create('Build', 'btnhumanbuild', 'cmdbuildhuman', 'B', [
//     Ability.Create('Build Townhall', 'btntownhall', 'htow', 'H', []),
//     Ability.Create('Build Arcane Vault', 'btnarcanevault', 'hvlt', 'V', [])
// ]),
